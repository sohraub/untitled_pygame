# untitled_pygame
Seeing how far I can get with my first real attempt at a game.

The only necessary non-standard library to run this is pygame, which can be installed with

`pip install pygame`

To run the game, simply run the command:

`python3 main.py`

Note that so far that has only been tested with Python 3.8, so you might run into issues if you're using an earlier 
version of Python.
